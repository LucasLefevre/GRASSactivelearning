	<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
	<p>
		This module uses SVM from the <em> scikit-learn </em> python package to perform classification on regions of raster maps. These regions can be the output of 
		<em><a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a></em> 
		or
		<em><a href="r.clump.html">r.clump</a></em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The module enables learning with only a small initial labeled data set via <em>active learning</em>. This semi-supervised learning algorithm interactively query the user to label the regions that are most useful to improve the overall classification score.
		With this technique, the number of examples to learn the classification is often much lower than the number of examples needed in normal supervised algorithms. You should start the classification with a small training set and run the module multiple times to label new informative samples to improve the overall classification score.
	</p>
	<p>
		The samples that are chosen to be labeled are the ones where the class prediction is the most uncertain.  Moreover, from the more uncertain samples, only the most different samples are kept. This diversity heuristic takes into account for each uncertain sample the distance to its closest neighbour and the average distance to all other samples. This ensures that newly labeled samples are not redundant whith each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		The learning data should be composed of features extracted from the regions, for example with the 
		<em><a href="i.segment.stats.html">i.segment.stats</a></em> 
		module

		The features of the training set, the test set and the unlabeled set should be in three diffenrent files in csv format. The first line of each file must be a header containing the features' name. Every regions should be uniquely identified by the first attribute. The classes for the training and test examples should be the second attribute.

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>training_set : Path to the training samples file</li>
		<li>test_set : Path to the test samples file</li>
		Example for the training and test files :
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
				cat,Class_num,attr1,attr2,attr3
				167485,4,3.546,456.76,6.76 
				183234,6,5.76,1285.54,9.45
				173457,2,5.65,468.76,6.78
			</pre>
		</div>
		<li>unlabeled : Path to the unlabeled samples file</li>
		Example for the unlabeled file :
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
				cat,attr1,attr2,attr3
				167485,3.546,456.76,6.76 
				183234,5.76,1285.54,9.45
				173457,5.65,468.76,6.78
			</pre>
		</div>
		<li>learning_steps : This is the number of samples that the module will ask to label at each run.</li>
		<li>nbr_uncertainty : Number of uncertain samples to choose before applying the diversity filter. This number should be lower than <em>learning_steps</em></li>
		<li>diversity_lambda (between 0 and 1): Parameter used in the diversity heuristic . If close to 0, only take into account the average distance to all other samples. If close to 1, only take into account the distance to the closest neighbour</li>
		<li>c_SVM : If it is too large, there is a risk of overfitting the training data. If it is too small you may have underfitting.</li>
		<li>gamma_SVM:</li>
		<li>update: Path to the update file. This file in csv format should have a header and two attributes per line : the ID of the sample you have labeled and the class itself.  If present, the module will transfer the samples to update from the unlabeled set to the training set, adding the class you have provided.  If the transfer of a sample is successful, the corresponding line in the file is deleted.</li>
		Example of an update file :
		<div class="code">
			<pre>
				cat,Class_num
				194762,2
				153659,6
				178350,2
			</pre>

	</ul>

	<h2>NOTES</h2>
	<p>
		This module requires the <em> scikit-learn </em> python package. This module needs to be installed in your GRASS GIS Python environment. Please refer to <a href="r.learn.ml.html"><em>r.learn.ml</em></a>'s Notes to install this package.
